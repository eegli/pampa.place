              project that aims to make it possible for everyone to explore any
              place in the world, without any limitations. it&apos;s built using
              data from google maps. at the time of writing, every google
              account gets{' '}
              <s>200$ per month for free to spend on the google maps</s>

              instead of paying for a service, the idea behind pampa.place is
              that everyone brings their own api key associated with their
              account. the game is optimized to use very little data from google
              maps - <s>200$ per month</s> can last for thousands of games.
