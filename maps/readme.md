# Maps

This folder holds all the GeoJSON map data and a script to preprocess GeoJSON data. Usage:

`node make-map.js <glob-pattern>`

Where `<glob-pattern>` is a pattern that should match the files you want to process. See the [pattern matching lib](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) for more info.
